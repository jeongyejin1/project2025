There was spotting for a month and slowed down to the point I now spot maybee 2 days a month. I&#039;ve now had it for 5 months and get cramps from time to time but they arent bad ones.

2) Would it mess with my monthly cycle? Yes, it did. I bled constantly, (in an array of colours!) for the obligatory 3 months that the GP told me to wait, until my body got used to it. Then it was another month before I finally went back to my GP and said &quot;Help&quot;. She gave me a progesterone pill told me to take it for a month. I only took it for only one week! It did the job, I stopped bleeding and have gone on to a normal cycle. My periods only last a couple of days, do not hurt and are light, (just a smear of blood).

4) Would I loose my sex drive? No, not so far. I was worried about this, however I am happy to say that I have noticed no difference. Sex is just as welcome and enjoyable as before.

I thought I was pregnant because of the dark color but that is also a side affect. Just breathe and let the pill do its work. Plan B and aftera are the same thing. Same ingredients.

Using this calculation, when the Generic Version falls within 80% to 125% of its Brand Name counterpart then it is considered a bioequivalent (meaning the Generic Version can be officially made-available as a cheaper alternative to the Brand Name version).

It is the only other thing besides daily antibiotics (doxycycline) that have controlled my acne. I tried Sprintec prior to this and it did nothing for my acne. Short term, I have had no side effects from Loryna. No weight gain, no extreme mood swings, nothing. My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching. 
Overall, I love Loryna for the shorter term, however if you plan to be on it for a few years, it may be concerning.

The first few days were four 10 mg pills a day and that sent me into orbit, but the spasms lessened. Then I was to go down to two a day and I managed to be awake here and there. Now I am on a daily dosage of one a day. The side effects are sleepiness and a little cognitive impairment, but the cramping has decreased by 97%. For me, this has been a total blessing. As I feel better I am thinking of switching to taking the one pill at night instead of the morning. But for now, I am changing nothing.

Be aware that it can cause akathisia, a movement disorder characterized by extreme restlessness, the constant need to move, anxiety and severe dysphoria. I had no name for my problem, and it was difficult to describe. I consulted my doctor and described the basic symptoms but he told me that it was my bipolar disorder causing this problem, not the medicine. He proceeded to tell me that the medicine was simply becoming ineffective. A week or two after I stopped this drug I felt better.

The Depo shot was my Birth control while taking it. I figured out my own dosage by how much I weighted and I started with 20 mg a day just to get used to it. Then went to 40 mg a day after a month. Then I finished my last 3 months with 60 mg a day, which was the correct dosage for my weight. 130 pounds. I avoided taking Vitamin A and drank plenty of water to help hydrate my skin. The best money I spent as well, compared to the years I spent trying everything else. I was tired of my acne killing my self-esteem, always covering up my chest and back, ashamed to take pictures. I know that depression is a potential symptom, but Taking Isotretinoin brought me nothing but happiness! I started seeing results in the first month. My pores shrank and my oily face and hair dramatically changed too. I have been off the medicine for a month and a half now still No acne at all, like not even one! My hair is back to normal now too, not as oily as it used to be. Overall I would strongly recommend it! But of course do a lot of research to see if it&#039;s right for you.

147728,Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I started taking Jolivette 5 months ago. First, to all you breastfeeding moms out there, I have had NO decrease in milk supply. And that from a woman who had to supplement with first 2 babies within their first 3 months because of low supply and low weight gain. My 3rd baby is now 5 1/2 months old and still exclusively breastfed and gaining weight beautifully. So it doesn&#039;t always affect milk supply.  I&#039;ve taken different BC pills before and always suffered severe anxiety and depression just before starting my period. I was worried about starting another pill but haven&#039;t had any problems yet. My first month on these pills I had a heavy period, but haven&#039;t had another one since. I&#039;m pretty happy with these pills""",8,3-Nov-17,1,1
214362,Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!! I used this product just tonight and it made me ich and burn worse than any yeast infection. I thought this would be a quick solution to avoid another awkward doctor visit. But I was wrong, do not use this unless you want your vagina to feel like it&#039;s being melted off. I douched with cool water and tried to get as much of the cream out as possible.""",1,21-Oct-15,1,0

49651,Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Before starting this pill, my flow was way too heavy! I would literally bleed through a super tampon and a pad in less than 2 hours. (horrible I know.) Also my skin would get pimples like crazy. Within the first 2 months my period was lighter and managable.  My acne also cleared up. But my mom and others would notice that I was super quiet, I&#039;m usually talkative, so she thought I was depressed. I&#039;m not completely sure it was the pill&#039;s fault. Currently I am off the pill to see if my flow has gotten lighter.  I&#039;m giving it a 9 because of the &quot;depression&quot; stage my peers thought I was going through.""",9,24-Jul-15,5,1
10236,Axiron,"Hypogonadism, Male","""It&#039;s only been a week, and so far I feel nothing except irritated underarms, I&#039;m assuming due to the alcohol content.
I asked my doctor to check testosterone level during my latest physical due to aging, gaining weight, lack of sex drive and basically feeling blah. They were indeed low so she put me onto this.""",1,29-Apr-12,15,0
34773,Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne since I was twelve and in 8th grade I developed moderate cystic acne which progressively got worse, so my doctor put me on minocycline and it totally cleared up my skin! I stopped getting cysts and I occasionally got one or two small white heads around the time of my period. I experienced minimal side effects, mostly nausea but it went away when I switched to taking the medication before bed. I&#039;ve been off minocycline for about 6 months and since then been out on birth control, I noticed that the new meds break me out in cysts a lot more so I&#039;ve started back on minocycline for the second time and my face is already clearer despite being on it for only a week! I love this stuff!""",8,18-Nov-14,14,1
13638,Amphetamine / dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""First drug I started taking for ADD a month ago. Took the 20 mg and it felt too intense and had a ton of side effects, but after 3-5 days, was tolerable but still suffered from really bad headaches and dry mouth all day. 2 weeks later, headaches finally stopped, but dry mouth was horrible, must have drank a gallon of water or more a day and had to have candy or gum all the time. But, I could tell I was a little more productive at work. At night, I would catch myself daydreaming worse than before and wondered if I was worse without it. I felt it basically replaced my coffee and then some, but the dry mouth wasn&#039;t worth it. I am now going to start taking Wellbutrin since I am a little depressed too and that drug is supposed to help with both.""",8,9-Dec-09,5,1
165982,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""This is the worst thing. Have had nothing but horrible pain since getting it 12 months ago . Have had it removed today after being hospitalised for excruciating pain. They could not find any reason as to why and I have always thought it was this horrible device. A medical
Professional also told me hers was removed due to issues and she had met many others who have suffered. Do not do it !""",1,8-Feb-17,6,0

I took a break from pills for a couple months and when I started back up, I started using Lutera. I&#039;ve been using it for 4-5 months and I feel horrible. I CAN say that It does a great job at protecting from birth and my periods haven&#039;t been a problem at all, but I feel horrible. I don&#039;t feel like myself at all. I feel disconnected/groggy almost all the time. My libido is completely gone now. Mood swings. I&#039;ve been so unlike myself for the past few months so I&#039;ve decided to stop taking them.""",3,17-Feb-16,9,0

147344,Alprazolam,Depression,"""Xanax is so great for me because I self-injure. It gives me the rational stance in my head when I feel like cutting myself. It doesn&#039;t allow me the energy to get so angry at myself. You just have to remember to actually take it when you feel your attack coming on and have patience for it to kick in. This is the best benzodiazepine because it works the fastest. Ativan is good sometimes. I saw trails but Xanax being the fastest but Klonopin lasts the longest.""",9,25-Nov-11,55,1

The next day I took just the Celexa, slept for an hour and a half again, this time the panic attack was much worse, dizzy, felt like getting sick, come close to calling 911.

severe migraine. The nurse told me the Benadryl could make my chest feel heavy and possibly anxious. Benadryl was pushed slowly via IV and I started feeling relaxed and sleepy. THEN came the Reglan! After the Reglan was administered my relaxed sleepy state reversed and I felt like I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm, I felt so hot like I was boiling from the inside out, I was so nauseous, my heart rate went wayyy up. I was in full panic mode feeling like I made a huge mistake!!! I told my husband to get the nurse and when he finally found him he did nothing for me except tell me to calm down! Ugh...
